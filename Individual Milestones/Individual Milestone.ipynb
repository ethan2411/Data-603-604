    "My initial set of queries is centered around age demographics to unravel their implications on crime rates and property assessments. We are driven by two key guiding questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are property assessments in communities related to age demographics?\n",
    "- Is crime in communities more prevalent when certain age groups are more present?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these questions, our queries focus on examining the proportion of different age groups in each community. Proportions were favored over counts to alleviate the bias introduced by more populous neighborhoods. The age groups were segmented into four brackets: Children (0-19), Young adults (20-45), Middle-aged adults (46-74), and Elderly (75+).\n",
    "\n",
    "We identified the top ten communities with the highest proportion of each age group, offering a snapshot of how age demographics vary across neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our final project, analyzing the correlation between age demographics and property assessments is pivotal. It helps us understand if specific age groups are associated with distinct property values. This insight can guide decisions related to property development, community planning, and investment strategies. Furthermore, exploring the prevalence of different age groups in communities with varying crime rates aims to uncover patterns suggesting correlations between age demographics and crime. This information is essential for informed policy development and targeted interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should distinct differences emerge within a particular age group, our plan is to expand the analysis. Sub-group analysis, such as comparing people aged 45-54 to those aged 55-64, will provide a more detailed understanding of the data."

    "Our subsequent set of queries focuses on gender demographics, aiming to shed light on their influence on crime rates and property assessments. We are guided by two key questions:\n",

    "- What is the relationship between gender distribution and property assessments?**\n",

    "\n",
    "We then sorted the communities by the proportion of female residents to organize the dataset though this can be re-arranged for future analysis as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the relationship between gender demographics and crime types/rates is crucial. This exploration can uncover patterns indicating correlations between gender distribution and specific crime types or rates. Such insights are valuable for targeted crime prevention strategies. Understanding the relationship between gender distribution and property assessments is equally important. This analysis can reveal if certain gender demographics are associated with different property values, guiding decisions related to property development, community planning, and investment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If distinct differences emerge within a particular gender group, our plan is to expand the analysis further. Sub-group analysis, such as comparing crime rates or property assessments among males, females, and others, will provide a more nuanced understanding of the data."

    "To address this question, our queries focus on examining the proportion of different property types in each community. Proportions are preferred over counts to account for variations in community sizes. Property types are categorized into five groups: Single Family, Apartment, Townhouse, Duplex, and Multiplex.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have identified the top ten communities with the highest proportion of each property type. This exploration provides insights into how property types vary across neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the relationship between property types and crime rates is pivotal. This exploration can reveal patterns indicating correlations between specific property types and crime rates or types. Understanding these connections is essential for implementing targeted crime prevention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If distinct differences emerge within a particular property type, our plan is to expand the analysis further. Sub-group analysis, such as comparing crime rates or types across different property types, will provide a more detailed understanding of the data."
